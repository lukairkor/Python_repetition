# Python Features
Lambda functions: also known as anonymous functions, these are small, one-time use functions that are defined using the lambda keyword, and can be used to create small, simple functions that are only used once.  
Generators: used to create iterators that generate values on the fly, generators are defined using a special type of function that contains one or more yield statements, which are used to return values from the function.  
List comprehensions: a concise and readable way to create lists, list comprehensions consist of an expression followed by one or more for clauses and zero or more if clauses, which are used to filter items from the list.  
Decorators: used to modify the behavior of functions and classes, decorators are defined using the @ symbol, and can be used to add functionality to existing code without modifying the original code.  
Context managers: used to manage resources like files, sockets, and databases, context managers are defined using the with keyword, and can be used to ensure that resources are properly closed and released when they are no longer needed.  
Iterators: used to iterate over a sequence of values, iterators are objects that implement the __iter__() and __next__() methods, which are used to retrieve the next value from the sequence.  
String formatting: used to create strings that contain variable values, string formatting can be done using the % operator or the format() method, which allows you to insert variable values into strings.  
Exception handling: used to handle errors and unexpected conditions in your code, exception handling allows you to handle errors in a way that does not cause the program to crash, and can be used to provide more informative error messages.
